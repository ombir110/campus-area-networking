# Campus Area Networking Project

## Overview
This project simulates a Campus Area Network (CAN) designed for an academic institution using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network includes multiple departments each segmented for security and efficiency.

## Features
- Design and implementation of a scalable campus network topology.
- Configuration of routers and switches with VLANs to separate department traffic.
- Use of dynamic routing protocols (OSPF) to enable inter-department communication.
- Implementation of DHCP for automated IP address assignment.
- Subnetting to optimize IP address usage.
- Access control lists (ACLs) for network security.
- Testing and troubleshooting using Cisco Packet Tracer simulation.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer (simulation and configuration)
- Networking concepts: VLAN, OSPF, DHCP, Subnetting, ACLs

## How to Use
1. Open the `campus-area-networking.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Explore the network topology with configured devices and VLANs.
3. Analyze routing tables and packet flows to understand network behavior.
4. Modify or expand the network to suit additional requirements.

## Project Structure
- `campus-area-networking.pkt`: Cisco Packet Tracer project file containing the full network setup.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
